# UNITED CARE ~LIFE OF GIVING

When it comes to charity organizations even though they serve a good purpose it still lacks trust, and donors are not acknowledged as to where the money has been transfered to, such as the donations may have been received to the appropriate beneficiary or may have been used for some inappropriate cause.

We have come up with a solution to establish trust among the donors, organizations and beneficiaries (who are associated with the organizations). With the help of blockchain technology we are establishing trust by verifying, validating and recording the transactions using  deployed smart charityApp contract on the network. The donors make payment to the verified organizations by ethereum tokens and each beneficiary is associated with a specific organization of their choice. The donors can check their transactions and transactions between organizations and the beneficiary.The donors get a complete view of all organizations in the applications and beneficiaries associated with the respective organizations. 

With blockchain technology we have created a decentralized system where participants are acknowledged and in control of their assets. With the advantage of distributed ledger technology we are keeping track of donors' money that has been transferred to the respective beneficiary. 

## Sequence of operations

1. Organizations sign up with details and a unique certificate number. The certificate number is to validate if the organization is legitimate and genuine.
2. An agent(such as government officials) will do the background check on the organizations using the unique certificate number provided. If the agent verifies and validates the organization as genuine and will promise beneficiaries for a good cause, then the agent approves the request, else declines.
3. Once the organization has successfully enrolled in the application we have the beneficiary sign up. Beneficiaries are the individuals who are in need of financial support. They sign up giving their details, amount needed for financial support and among all the verified organizations listed, which single organization they would like to associate with. 
4. After the beneficiary signs up and chooses the organization. The organization receives the beneficiary request. They can verify and if they feel the beneficiary is in dire need for financial support and the cause is genuine they can approve the beneficiary's raised request, else reject them if the requested amount is not worthy.
5. Donors’ sign up by providing their details. After successfully signing up he gets to view all the organizations and the beneficiaries associated with respect to that organization. 
6. The organization has the feature to enable voting phase for every beneficiary associated with them. Each donor will have one vote for a beneficiary in that organization and will donate funds to the organization after voting to the beneficiary. Between the vote start phase and end phase, if the beneficiary receives more or equal to threshold votes set, then the organization transfers funds to the beneficiary from the total funds they received from donors.
7. Each donor should at least transfer 10 eth to the organization and will have only one vote per beneficiary. It is up to the donor to vote for the beneficiary and transfer funds to the organization or only transfer funds to the organization without voting.
8. In order to transfer funds from organization to beneficiary, the beneficiary should receive more than or equal to the threshold votes set between the start and end phase. The organization should have more funds than the beneficiary requested, else the organization will wait till they receive the requested amount and then transfer to the eligible beneficiary who has achieved the threshold votes. Organizations can only transfer the beneficiary requested amount, if they try to transfer more or less it will throw an error.
9. If the beneficiary couldn’t receive the number of threshold votes then the beneficiary won’t be eligible for their funds to be sanctioned. These are some validations and features which have been incurred in the application.
10. We have provided the distributed ledger view to all the participants to view if the transactions have been reached to desired accounts.
